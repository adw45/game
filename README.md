# game
Not really sure what my plans are with this game, some of my early plans are to use Phaser to create a multiplayer online game.
Including Socket.io and node backend.


I'm thinking a tile based diablo 2 style game, but im more-so trying to work on learning the framework for now.

Starting the game:
cd ~game/client
http-server 
localhost:8080/index.html


Using browserify/watchify:
cd ~game/client
watchify src/main.js -o src/output.js --verbose
